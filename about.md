Hi, I am Ying Peng. I graduated from Uppsala University with a Master's degree in Data Science-Machine Learning and Statistics.

I am an NLP researcher at Zhuiyi Technology, primarily focused on improving the quality of semantic search in information retrieval.

Currently, I am increasingly interested in the field of safety issues related to large language models.
