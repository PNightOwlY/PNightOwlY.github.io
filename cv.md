## Experience
- **NLP Researcher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 09.2022 ~ Now**
  - Contributed to the design of a SaaS-based enterprise intelligent customer service platform which involves task-oriented(finite state machine), skill-based(external API service), FAQ(semantic matching&knowledge graph), document retrieval(semantic matching), and information retrieval(web crawler) chatbots.
  - Building an education platform that is a dialogue logging system for intent and task mining, conversation analysis, and potential business opportunities mining, aiming to enhance the user experience.
  - Conducted an in-depth investigation into the application of semantic models in information retrieval.
  - Participated in the design of fine-tuning strategies for LLM models, contributing to their overall performance and effectiveness.
  - Developing an LLM experience platform from scratch, including architecture designing, data modeling, user authentication, license issuance, and container orchestration.
  
  

- **Master Thesis Student &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annika Waern's Lab &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01.2022 ~ 07.2022**
  - The intention of the project was to develop an AI-based system that reduces the cost and ensures the effectiveness of physical therapy by providing training schedules and correcting wrong patient motions.
  - A solution of utilizing human motion sensor to collect data and do motion recognition for patients with deep learning model and transfer learning methods.
  - The final outcome demonstrated the effectiveness of the solution. Its rapid fine-tuning speed and accurate motion recognition rate exceeding 80\% have met the satisfaction of the lab. Consequently, the laboratory has decided to continue utilizing and researching this solution.
- **Research Assistant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UU-InfoLab &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.2021 ~ 01.2022**
  - Applied machine learning to explain image classification algorithms. VGG, ResNet and explainability AI(XAI) tools such as Grad-CAM and LIME were used.
  - Conducted transfer learning on various image categories on the YouTube Dataset. Have a deep understanding of transfer learning and usages, which plays an important factor in master thesis research.
  - Provide explainability methodology for social scientists understand how deep learning model classify images.
 
- **Data Engineer (Intern) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 06.2021 ~ 09.2021**
  - Assist in the completion of WDM data analysis, design algorithms to find out the same routing problem; Helping network operation and maintenance personnel improve the accuracy and efficiency of judging multiple bare fiber single-point problems, which has been recognized by business executives.
  - Design intelligent QA-chatbot framework and algorithms (logistics regression algorithm, deep learning model). The intelligent question answering robot has good initial performance, high answer accuracy, and fast speed.
